# Login 500 Error - Fixed! ✅

## Problem
You were getting a **500 Internal Server Error** when trying to log in.

## Root Cause
The AI agents (daily digest, leetcode, flashcard, resume, interview) were being initialized **at startup** (when the server starts), which could cause errors before any requests were even made.

### Original Code (Problematic)
```python
# Agents were loaded immediately at module import
daily_digest_agent = create_daily_digest_agent(...)
leetcode_agent = create_leetcode_agent(...)
flashcard_agent = create_flashcard_agent(...)
resume_agent = create_resume_agent(...)
interview_agent = create_interview_agent(...)
```

This meant:
- If any agent initialization failed (API keys missing, network issues, etc.), the entire backend would crash
- Even login (which doesn't need agents) would fail with a 500 error

## Solution
Changed to **lazy loading** - agents are only created when they're actually needed.

### Fixed Code
```python
# Lazy load agents to avoid startup errors
_daily_digest_agent = None
_leetcode_agent = None
_flashcard_agent = None
_resume_agent = None
_interview_agent = None

def get_daily_digest_agent():
    global _daily_digest_agent
    if _daily_digest_agent is None:
        _daily_digest_agent = create_daily_digest_agent(model_name="llama-3.1-8b-instant")
    return _daily_digest_agent

# ... similar for other agents
```

Now:
- ✅ Backend starts successfully even if agents have issues
- ✅ Login works immediately (no agents needed)
- ✅ Agents are only created when user actually uses AI features
- ✅ Each agent is created once and reused

## Files Modified
- `studybuddy/api/endpoints.py` - Added lazy loading functions

## Testing
1. Backend starts successfully ✅
2. Health check passes ✅
3. Login should now work ✅

## What You Can Do Now
1. **Start the frontend:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```

2. **Try logging in:**
   - Go to the Account page
   - Create an account or log in
   - Should work without 500 errors!

3. **Test AI features:**
   - Once logged in, try creating a TODO
   - Try the Daily Digest feature
   - Agents will be created on first use

## Benefits
- **Faster startup** - Backend starts immediately
- **Better error handling** - Agent errors don't crash everything
- **Graceful degradation** - App works even if AI features are temporarily unavailable
- **Resource efficient** - Only load what's needed

**Status: ✅ FIXED**

You can now login without the 500 error!
